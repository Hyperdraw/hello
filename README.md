# Hello [![Status](https://travis-ci.com/Hyperdraw/hello.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Hyperdraw/hello)
A simple hello world program to demonstrate C and Makefiles.

## Building Hello

For Unix-style systems, you will need to install the GCC compiler along with the Make build tool. Do so with:

`sudo apt-get install gcc make`

On Windows, you will need to download [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com).

Finally, to build Hello, just type `make` into the terminal (or the Cygwin shell on windows). The executable, called `hello`, will be placed next to the makefile.
To run the executable on windows, you will need to rename it `hello.exe`.
